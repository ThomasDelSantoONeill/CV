# CV in Rmarkdown
This template adds some minor tweaks to the CV template provided by [isteves](https://github.com/isteves/resume); which is in turn a
modification of the versions by [svmiller](https://github.com/svmiller/svm-r-markdown-templates) and 
[ryanpeek](https://github.com/ryanpeek/markdown_cv).

## Usage
Download and open the **.Rmd** file and edit the subfields appropriately. For further layout improvements referred to the **.tex** file and
change accordingly.

## Dependencies
To compile the CV to **.pdf** you'll need [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/), [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) and of course the [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) package.
